### Unpublished games in typescript
**TypeScript** is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that adds optional type annotations and other features to enhance the development experience. It was designed to address some of JavaScriptâ€™s limitations by providing compile-time type checking, which helps catch errors early in the development process and improve code quality. TypeScript integrates seamlessly with JavaScript, allowing developers to gradually adopt its features and compile TypeScript code into standard JavaScript that runs in any browser or JavaScript environment. Its support for modern JavaScript features, such as async/await and ES6 modules, combined with strong typing and interfaces, makes it ideal for building large-scale and maintainable applications. TypeScript is increasingly popular in both frontend and backend development, especially in conjunction with frameworks like Angular, and it offers tools for refactoring, better code navigation, and enhanced IDE support.
